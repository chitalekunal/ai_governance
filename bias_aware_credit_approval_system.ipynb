        "# @markdown I’ve been hearing a lot about how AI is getting regulated in Europe (the EU AI Act), so I wanted to see if I could actually \"break\" a credit-scoring model and then fix it. <br/>The goal here isn't just to make a model that's 99% accurate. It’s to build a model that doesn't accidentally become a jerk by discriminating against people based on their gender or age. In the EU, if your AI does that, you're in big trouble—so I’m playing \"AI Ethics Lead\" for a day to see how it works. 😁\n",
        "# @markdown ## 2. How I know it discriminates?\n",
        "# @markdown In Europe, the concern about AI bias isn't just a \"gut feeling\"—it's based on high-profile cases where algorithms actually failed, combined with a very specific legal philosophy about human rights. notifications of The Dutch \"Childcare Benefit\" Scandal , The \"CV Ghosting\" in Recruitment, Predictive Policing in Belgium & Italy are some of them. Well I am not targetting to solve all of them but surely this usecase can help understand how it all works and how companies can buidl a robust system around it."
